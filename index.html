            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              My Name is Warren Clark. I am from Knoxville Tennessee and naturally, I love the UT Vols.
              I have a lovely family. My wife, Allison, and my son Leo who is eight. I currently have a stable
              of animals that we take care of, Quails, Rabbits, and four crazy Dogs. I am employed at Target 
              as a Target Security Specialist. Through Target's affiliation with Guild I am attending a bootcamp
              that will help me pursue a career as Full-Stack Web Developer!
